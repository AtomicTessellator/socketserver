# WebSocket Channel Server

A WebSocket server that implements a pub/sub pattern with exchanges and channels. This server allows clients to subscribe to channels within exchanges and broadcast messages to all subscribers.

## Architecture

The server is built on a three-tier hierarchy:
- **Exchange**: Top-level container that can hold multiple channels
- **Channel**: A unique communication pathway within an exchange
- **Client**: WebSocket connections subscribed to channels

### Components

- `ExchangeManager`: Manages multiple exchanges
- `Exchange`: Contains channels and handles channel operations via ChannelManager
- `ChannelManager`: Manages subscriptions and message broadcasting
- `Channel`: Maintains list of subscribed clients and handles message distribution

## Message Types

```javascript
CHANNEL_SUBSCRIBE = 0     // Subscribe to a channel
CHANNEL_UNSUBSCRIBE = 1   // Unsubscribe from a channel
CHANNEL_PUBLISH = 2       // Publish a message to a channel
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm start
```

The server runs on port 5000 by default and provides health check endpoints at:
- `http://0.0.0.0:5000/`
- `http://0.0.0.0:5000/health`
- `http://0.0.0.0:5000/healthcheck`

### Client Message Format

Messages must be valid JSON objects with the following required fields:

```javascript
{
    "exchange": "string",   // Exchange identifier (max length: 1000)
    "channel": "string",    // Channel identifier (max length: 1000)
    "type": number         // Message type (0-10000)
}
```

### Message Types
- Types 0-999: Reserved for system messages
- Types 1000+: Available for application messages

### Example Client Connection

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5000');

// Subscribe to a channel
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    exchange: "my-exchange",
    channel: "my-channel",
    type: 0  // CHANNEL_SUBSCRIBE
}));

// Publish to a channel
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    exchange: "my-exchange",
    channel: "my-channel",
    type: 1000,
    data: "Hello, World!"
}));
```

## Features

- Dynamic exchange and channel creation
- Automatic client cleanup on disconnect
- Message validation and error handling
- Heartbeat support (configure with LOG_HEARTBEATS environment variable)
- Structured logging via logger utility
- Input validation:
  - JSON message format
  - Required fields checking
  - Exchange/channel identifier length limits
  - Message type range validation (0-10000)

## Environment Variables

- `LOG_HEARTBEATS`: Set to 'true' to enable heartbeat logging
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 5000)

## Error Handling

The server validates all incoming messages and will return error responses for:
- Invalid JSON
- Missing required fields (`exchange`, `channel`, `type`)
- Invalid message types (must be 0-10000)
- Invalid exchange/channel identifiers (must be strings, max length 1000)
